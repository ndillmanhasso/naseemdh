abstract: The connections between climate change and mental health are well known (Berry et al., 2010; Clayton and Manning 2018; Kim et al., 2014). Research also points to the positive impacts of nature on mental health, well-being, and attention (Capaldi et al., 2015; Kaplan and Kaplan 1989; Tillmann et al., 2018). However, no empirical research has examined how degradation of nature as a result of climate change can impact the mental health benefits that nature provides. This paper first reviews the existing research on the negative mental health consequences of climate change and the benefits of nature exposure for stress, mental health, and well-being. The connection between these two lines of research is examined in order to fully understand the impacts of climate change on mental health. Suggestions for future research are included.

summary: Nature and climate change independently affect mental health. This paper argues for a need to look at how climate change is affecting nature access, and how that buffer affects mental health.
